create local standalone version of pyqtgraph that can be backed up as needed:

git clone https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph-core.git
rename to pyqtgraph_core, as - does not work for import

update with git pull

ScatterPlotItem needs several fixes to work with the current version of PyQt5:


arr = self.atlasData[x:x+w, y:y+w]
--> arr = self.atlasData[int(x):int(x+w), int(y):int(y+h)]

self.atlasData = np.zeros((width, height, 4), dtype=np.ubyte)
--> self.atlasData = np.zeros( (int(width), int(height), 4), dtype=np.ubyte)

self.atlasData[x:x+w, y:y+h] = rendered[key]
--> self.atlasData[int(x):int(x+w), int(y):int(y+h)] = rendered[key]
