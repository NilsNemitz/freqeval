If required, install python through mini-conda distribution:
32 bit (for compatibility with 32 bit dll used by frequency counter)
version 3.6.x

install scipy:
conda install scipy

install pyqt
conda install pyqt
(will get version 5.6.0 automatically)

install pandas data mining libray
conda install pandas

install main freqeval program:
git clone https://github.com/NilsNemitz/freqeval


create local standalone version of pyqtgraph that can be backed up as needed:

from freqeval directory:
git clone https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph-core.git
rename to pyqtgraph_core, as - does not work for import

update with git pull

ScatterPlotItem needs several fixes to work with the current version of PyQt5:

line 148:
arr = self.atlasData[x:x+w, y:y+w]
--> arr = self.atlasData[int(x):int(x+w), int(y):int(y+h)]

line 183:
self.atlasData = np.zeros((width, height, 4), dtype=np.ubyte)
--> self.atlasData = np.zeros( (int(width), int(height), 4), dtype=np.ubyte)

line 186:
self.atlasData[x:x+w, y:y+h] = rendered[key]
--> self.atlasData[int(x):int(x+w), int(y):int(y+h)] = rendered[key]



Getting AllanTools:
  git clone https://github.com/aewallin/allantools
