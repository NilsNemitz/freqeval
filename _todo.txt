TODO:

- add header line to output files on file creation

TO FIX:

- re-sync at UTC 0:00 creates bad frequency data, but marked GOOD.



frequency eval:

choose baseline/correction for plot offset

implement range of good data to use

create information / mask file for each loaded dataset

start statisitics for retained data

load/save channel data table (.set file?)
make corrections editable
copy mean values to clipboard?
make filter selection toggleable
allow re-running filters for changed settings

## done ## implement masking
## done ## load/save mask to .msk file

## done ## implement "matrix"-table for comb parameters to allow reconstruction of actual frequency
## done ## check that baseline-subtracted data remain small enough for 1E-19 rounding errors
## done ## calculate baseline correction for absolute frequency in arbitrary precision

Allan deviations for individual in-loop signals
Allan deviation for Sr/In combined signals

allow appending new data
automate reload every X minutes

file export

re-label fake logarithmic axes in ADev plot
add gridlines

add report generation to ascii file
add "good data" export to ascii file for sanity checking
add "evaluated time series" export

add updates to status bar

toggle-button to show raw frequencies or evaluation result as time series

add shortcuts to set window divisions to convenient values:
 - focus on single channel analysis
 - focus on relative frequency results
 - overall view including Allan deviations
